Dear Sir/Madam,

At the FlightGear (a GPL flight simulator) forum we are considering using your dragon model for this project:

http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=27814

Now I was wondering, since I don't seem to find the proper answer:
Is the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license used by you compatible with GPL? And if it's not would you consider a different license which is GPL compatible for the dragon model?

Kind Regards,

Erik Hofman 


Response:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi,

For such questions you better ask the FSF or check www.fsf.org.
it is also unclear which dragon you mean, the ones from Sintel? As representative of the Blender Foundation (copyright holder of open movies) I can assure you that we will be fine when you use it in a GPL project.
